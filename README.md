# Overview

чаша means "cup" in Bulgarian, and is a play on the larger Python Web Frameworks such as Bottle and Flask. However, instead of targetting the WWW, Chasha 
targets the Gopher protocol; it includes simple classes for handling Routes, Directories, Images & the like.

# Rationale

 Why not? We have Lamson for route-oriented SMTP, and Bottle/Flask/... for Web, may as well have one (or more!) for Gopher.

 Addtionally, this allows me to create a non-Digamma reference implementation for some extensions I was thinking of for Gopher+
